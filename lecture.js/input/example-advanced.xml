<!-- define a chapter name (optional) -->

<mark name="intro" chapter="Intro" />

<!-- play a sound file -->

<audio src="audio-example.m4a" clipEnd="2s" />

This is the first spoken sentence. We are on the first slide deck, page 1. Now, we go to the next page on the currently active slide deck!

<slide page="+1" />

Now we are on page 2 of the same slide deck.

<image src="test1.png" fit="fill" />

And now, instead of the slides, an image file is shown.

<break time="1000ms" />

<slide page="+1" />

It's also simply possible to switch languages mid-sentence. Amazon Polly voices work better for this purpose than Google Cloud voices. For a test, this will be <de>ausgesprochen in Deutsch</de>. It's German with an English accent.

<!-- the <de> element here is equivalent to elements <de-DE> and <lang xml:lang="de-DE"> -->

<slide page="+1" />

Now, it'll switch the voice.

<voice name="google-en-us-wavenet-e">

    This sentence will be spoken by a Google Cloud voice.

</voice>

This sentence is spoken in the default voice again. But, we will change the currently shown deck of slides!

<slide deck="slides2" page="1" />

Now, we have a new slide deck opened.

<image src="test2.png" fit="contain" />

The last part of this sentence will be <emphasis level="strong">very strongly emphasized</emphasis>. 

And we'll have a <break time="1s" /> break.

<slide page="2" />

<mark name="lexicon-explanation" chapter="Lexicon Explanation" />

You can also use lexicons to correct the pronunciation of words!

<lookup ref="lexicon1">
    Now a lexicon is used to pronounce the SSEENTENZ correctly.

    <lookup ref="lexicon2">
        Now the second lexicon has priority and the first lexicon serves as a fallback.
        As a test: red will be pronounced as green.

        But since lexicon 1 is the fallback, and the word <emphasis level="strong">sentence</emphasis> is not defined in lexicon 2, the word "SSEENTENZ" will still be correctly pronounced.
    </lookup>
</lookup>

If a lexicon is too much, you can also use the sub element, if a word is pronounced incorrectly. The sub element defines an alias which is spoken instead of the <sub alias="text">bla bla blub</sub> within.

If you are using an Amazon Polly voice, you can also apply a phonetic alphabet using the <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈfoʊ nim">phoneme</phoneme> element. It defines the pronunciation of a <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="wɜrd">WOOOOOOORRRRRRRDDD</phoneme>.

<break time="700ms" />

<mark name="video-section" chapter="Video section" />

Now, a video will be shown!

<video src="video-example.mp4" clipEnd="00:00:03.500" keepFrame="true" />

The video was paused at 3.5 seconds and now continues.

<video src="video-example.mp4" clipBegin="3500ms" keepFrame="true" />

This sentence will be spoken after the video clip, but while the last frame of the video is still shown.

<slide deck="slides1" page="last" />

This sentence is spoken over the last page on the first slide deck.

<mark name="end345" />

This sentence will be ignored, because it comes after the endmark of the name "end345".
