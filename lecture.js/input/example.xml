Welcome to a short example that will demonstrate the basic features of the software.

Currently, slide 1 is set as the active slide deck.

<slide page="+1" />

Now we are on the second page of slide 1. 
We can also change the slide deck that is open!

<slide deck="slides2" page="1" />

It is also possible to change languages. For a test, this will be <de>ausgesprochen in Deutsch</de>. It spoke German with an English accent.

We can also add breaks and a lot of other cool stuff!

<break time="1500ms" />

It is possible to insert images!

This program can also play audio files.

<audio src="audio-example.m4a" />

And videos too!

<video src="video-example.mp4" />
